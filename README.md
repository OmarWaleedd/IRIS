# IRIS Classification
# The Iris classification project employed a comprehensive approach by integrating K-means clustering, Decision Trees, and Random Forest algorithms to effectively classify Iris flower species. K-means clustering was employed to identify natural groupings within the dataset, facilitating an initial understanding of the inherent patterns. Subsequently, Decision Trees were applied to create a structured classification model based on distinct features, providing transparency in the decision-making process. To enhance predictive accuracy and robustness, Random Forest, an ensemble learning technique, was introduced. The combination of these algorithms not only improved the precision of species classification but also offered insights into the underlying data structure. This multi-faceted approach showcased the power of combining clustering and ensemble learning methods for a more holistic and accurate Iris classification model.
